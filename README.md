# Cardme

Cardme is a JS suite you can drop in the console on any FP ticket list to turn it into cards, and also clean out some useless script/styles.

### Usage

0. Set your `Title Column Format` to **Include Collapsed Description in Title** under

> Preferences > Homepage > Title Column Options

within your FP Settings

1. Copy the entirety of `card_me.js` to your clipboard
2. Go to any FP ticket main page and open your `console`
3. Paste and hit enter, cards should appear

>As this is essentially a tech demo until integration with the FP extension, reloading will wipe all changes.
